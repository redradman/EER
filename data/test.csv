  Sauder Courses,COMM 280 (102-103/201-202),Entrepreneurship,"•	Understand key considerations, opportunities and challenges for the entrepreneur. 
•	Gain experience with and access to core entrepreneurial processes, tools and resources. 
•	Explore your own potential as an entrepreneur. 
•	Work with a preliminary outline of what your own innovative entrepreneurial venture might look like.","The modules, in the order in which we will cover them, are as follows: 
1- Venturing In 
This first module will introduce you to some of the “big picture” concepts of entrepreneurship as it relates to you, individually.  We will look at what motivates people to pursue entrepreneurship, how people deal with risk, and reflect on inspiring and cautionary tales of entrepreneurs, among others.  In this module we will focus on how you think and feel about entrepreneurship, based on what you know now. 
2	- Testing Ideas 
The next module deals with one of the most challenging parts of early entrepreneurship: coming up with an idea.  In this module we will focus on where ideas come from and how they develop.  An important part of this module will be to move beyond just an “interesting” idea to an idea with a viable business approach.   What is your value proposition?  How will you satisfy your customer’s needs?  Do enough people want this product/service to be worth the time, effort, and money you will put into it? 
3	- Building It Out 
Assuming your idea is sound, what happens next?  What will your company and product/service be about?  How will people interface with you to buy your product/service?  In this module we will examine how you build a brand identity, come up with a go-to-market strategy, and develop a roadmap to strategically plan your future. 
4	– Founder’s Decisions 
In this module, we will focus on some of the key decisions a founder of a new company will face.  These include building an initial team, navigating legal steps, finding advisors, and deciding on the core vision and mission of the company (e.g., social and environmental goals).  Being surrounded by a great team and a set of key mentors is one of the most important aspects of any successful company.  Knowing what it is you are trying to accomplish and why, is another. 
5	– Money Matters 
In the final module we will examine some core concepts and principles behind money in entrepreneurial ventures.  This includes early and venture capital financing, developing a business module and plan, understanding revenue and pricing, and company equity (i.e., ownership shares).

Team Project Prototypes (see Canvas>Assignments for details)  
Prototyping is a core and critical concept for entrepreneurs. Prototyping involves experimenting with rough concepts and translating them into tangible outputs for feedback and testing. Students will form small startup teams (3-5) based on aligned/interested problem>idea spaces. Startup teams will generate prototypes (draft outputs): customer personas, product/service prototypes and business model canvas. The prototypes will be iterated, refined and integrated into the final group project.   
   
Team/Group Final Project (see Canvas>Assignments for details)  
Successful entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs are storytellers. Startup student teams will summarize and synthesize their Startup journey of hypotheses pivots, simple market research insights, product/service prototype feedback, and high-level financial and go to market plan. The teams will follow the marketdriven innovation process and will present their Startup story: comprised of an elevator pitch, product/service idea and associated business model. Group project proposals and presentations will be judged on their market desirability, resource feasibility and financial viability.  ",

Class participation is very important in this course and accounts for a significant amount of the final grade. I view class discussion as a way of learning from each other: you can learn a lot from listening to your fellow students and you can learn a lot from thinking about the comments you want to make. Most importantly it encourages you to think critically. Participation marks depend on class attendance, class conduct and the frequency and quality of classroom contributions.
Case memos
There will be a total of 6 case studies, and you need to hand in (electronically) a case memo for each case. A case memo consists of one or two pages and will provide answers to the study questions posted on Canvas. Your best five case memos will be worth 4% each of the overall evaluation. You need to attend the class of the case discussion to obtain marks for the assignment. Non-attendance in the class case discussions will result in 50% of the memo grade.
Simulations
During the course you will be participating in four strategic innovation and entrepreneurship simulations, developed by Harvard Business School: The Foodtruck Challenge, Breaking News, Crossing the Chasm and Back Bay Battery. All of the simulations will be done in groups in class. Your performance in each of the simulations is worth 2.5% of the evaluation.
New Venture Simulation: The Food Truck Challenge
In this online simulation, you will run a food truck in the city of Boomtown. Your goal is to achieve maximum revenue over 5 simulated weeks and win the ""Food Truck Challenge."" In each round, you will make decisions about where to park and what menu item to offer in hopes of finding the best menu- location combination and yielding the highest sales. You will need to analyse market data and make a plan, but you will also need to make decisions as to whether to go to scale right away with the food truck, conduct further research and analysis, or to experiment with a low-capacity pushcart.
   COMM/R 382 201, 202 2 March 15, 2023
 Crossing the Chasm
Many new products and ventures fail in the marketplace. One reason for this is that most innovations fail to make a mark in the mainstream market. This simulation allows you to experience the frustrations and challenges of taking a disruptive innovation from initial success with early adopters to widespread adoption by the mainstream market. You will play the role of executives in a self-driving vehicle technology firm that has garnered significant attention from the early adopter market but is struggling to break in to the mainstream market. Investors are now looking for exponential growth through mainstream adoption. You will be tasked to assess the market segments that have shown interest in self-driving vehicles (SDVs), develop the appropriate product solution for their selected segments, and achieve the growth promised by the technology.
Breaking News
You will manage the innovation process for a struggling newspaper. You will need to develop new ideas to counter the company’s declining sales, subscriptions, and web traffic. Working with limited time and budget, you must decide how to source new ideas and where to set priorities. You will then need to review the resulting list of ideas, evaluate and test them, and submit the best possible innovation strategy to the CEO. You will gain experience of managing innovation in an organization and the trade- offs between different types of innovation.
Back Bay Battery
You will form part of the management team of a battery manufacturer. You will be responsible for determining the appropriate level and timing of R&D expenditures for both an existing technology and a new emerging energy storage technology. To be successful, you will need to formulate a comprehensive strategy and then adapt it as you adjust to the dynamic marketplace. You will need to identify the most critical pieces of data for analysis and make decisions in an uncertain environment.
There are two criteria that form the basis of the assessment in this simulation: Cumulative profit over the duration of the simulation and “health of the business” in the final period.
You will start by running a series of practice rounds in the simulation to gain familiarity with the business, the market and the interface. The simulation will then be reset and changed to “advanced” mode, where you will also need to make sales predictions.
Presentation
There will be short student presentations in each class from the third week of the course. You are required to present (in small groups) a 5 minute presentation on an innovation of your choosing. In your presentation, you should explain:
• Why did you choose this innovation? Why is it important?
• What is the story behind the creative process behind the innovation? What enabled it to be
discovered?
• How was the innovation commercialized? Who captured the profits?
• What course concepts are relevant to the innovation and the organisations involved?
Final assessment
There is a final, individual, written assignment for the course. Detailed information is available on Canvas.

•	Apply these frameworks to particular situations 
•	Sharpen your ability to diagnose and solve a broad range of organizational innovation challenges from the perspective of an innovation leader. 
•	Learn how to lead a start-up, innovation efforts in more established organizations, create innovation ecosystems and positive changes in society through innovation.","Using MBA style pedagogy, I will introduce you to frameworks from the social sciences that are useful for understanding organizational innovation processes and teach you how to apply these frameworks to particular situations. This course is designed to sharpen your ability to diagnose and solve a broad range of organizational innovation challenges from the perspective of an innovation leader. The lessons of the course have direct relevance to leading a start-up, leading innovation efforts in more established organizations, creating innovation ecosystems, and creating positive changes in society through innovation.
You are expected to show a high level of commitment to preparing for class each day. You should expect to come to class and be pushed to think actively. I do not believe in passive learning. This means that information will not be packaged into lectures for you to memorize. Readings and suggested review readings and questions are provided to give grounding for each day’s discussion. You should come to class ready to absorb lessons from the examples we will discuss. Many class meetings will be organized around active interactive case or interview analyses. Failure to prepare adequately for the cases and interviews will jeopardize your ability to learn in this course. If you put in the appropriately high level of effort I assure you this will be a course you will not forget.
By design, the composition of students in the class comes from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. This course builds upon theories some of you may have learned in previous courses, and some of you have not. As such, you will be encouraged to re-review various theories as appropriate for our daily discussions. Do not worry if a particular theory or topic is suggested to review that you have not dealt with previously – some of your classmates likely have and some have not. In fact, if you are not familiar with a particular theory there is a good chance you will have a unique theoretical perspective from your own past courses, readings and experiences to draw upon and integrate to make the discussions even stronger. Please share your own unique experiences as appropriate to help others learn from them. The case analyses and interview discussions will take your level of theoretical understanding to a new level through

 Data gathering - How well (i.e., thoroughly and appropriately) do you collect data to inform your change plan? This can take the form of interviews, survey questions, existing data, observations, etc.
 Integration of course concepts - How well do you integrate course concepts and academic literature (both from this course and previous courses) to facilitate successful implementation of your proposed change effort?
 Extent to which implementation plan recommendations are consistent with proposed change – Do your implementation plan recommendations match your proposed change?
 Feasibility and specificity of plan – Can this change plan be successfully initiated and led by a small group of students? Will it catch on and grow into a full systemic change? How specific is your implementation plan (including stages, intermediate goals, markers of success at each stage, key actors to gain support from, etc.)? Have you discussed potential barriers to change and how to overcome them?
 Quality of writing
 Quality of oral presentation  Group Project: You will join a group at the end of class on Day 3. With that group you will conduct an innovation experience interview, of at least 30 minutes, with someone who works in an innovation role locally someplace in the Greater Vancouver area.

The sector currently represents over $1tn of investment capital. This course provides an introduction to the impact investment sector and the related responsible investing sector, describes the evolution of impact investment, the growth of new asset classes, and the opportunities and challenges faced by investors seeking meaningful impact investment vehicles.

According to the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), impact investing is defined as “investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. Impact investing, has emerged over the past decade as one of the most talked about strategies for tackling social and environmental problems. With the goal of creating measurable impact in addition to financial returns, impact investing selects ventures working towards positive social or environmental outcomes.  The concepts of impact investing and social enterprise emerged out of a recognition that the private sector could also contribute to the development of social agendas, while gaining a financial return.  Rather than focusing solely on a risk-return nexus, impact investing broadens to the “triple bottom line” to include financial, social, and environmental gains.
Related but distinct from impact investing, is the field of responsible investing (RI). According to the Responsible Investment Association of Canada (RIA), RI is refers to the incorporation of environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) into the selection and management of investments. RI focuses on public market investing, in both retail and institutional contexts, and encompasses a variety of portfolio construction and stewardship strategies, including proxy voting, filing shareholder resolutions and shareholder engagement.
Through a combination of readings, discussions, guest lectures, research, a pitch competition and a portfolio allocation project, students will gain deep insight into the different perspectives brought by the impact investor who is concerned with stimulating social and environmental impact while generating financial return.  

Business students will complete the course having obtained a strong understanding of the positive impacts financial tools can have economically, socially, and environmentally. Students will also acquire practical knowledge of the tools and methodologies brought to impact investment decisions and assessments. ","•	Disclosure Review Report

This course aims to regularly connect theory to the real world. At the end of many lectures, a challenge will be posed to find a real world example of a business or institution that exemplifies the models from the previous lecture. Groups will be randomly assigned, and will have until the start of the subsequent class to find an example and offer their own insights and opinions related to the topic. At the start of the next class, groups will summarize their findings and present back to the class. A presentation file as required by the assignment will be submitted to Canvas to fulfill the requirements of this assignment. There are no makes-ups for missed in-class exercises; attendance is required to earn these marks. 
Innovation Case Study (Throughout the course, randomly assigned slots, 12%)
This assignment focuses on identifying examples of innovative sustainable products. The presentation will take the form of a sales pitch to the class in a maximum of five minutes. You can choose any product or service you like and think the class will enjoy. You need to cover the following items:
1.	What is social or environmental problem this product is designed to solve?
2.	What are the features or attributes of the product that reduce its impact relative to competitors?
3.	How price competitive is the product relative to the incumbents
4.	What are the limitations of the product?
5.	Finish with a strong advertising tag line for the product: i.e. Vancity – Making Good Money or Happy Planet: Feel Good Food
Feel free to have fun with the format and presentation style. This is an individual assignment. 
Case Reports (2 cases, 15% each, in self formed pairs)
Case studies are used to apply the concepts, frameworks, and tools from the course, to learn how to analyze incomplete information, and to make decisions as an innovator. Each case is a real-world situation that actually happened, and students are given the same information that the protagonist had at the time. Working in pairs, students will use the course tools and concepts to analyze the information, make a decision, and explain why their decision is the best course of action. 
Investment Thesis/Pitch/Memo (3-part assignment in self formed groups)
Investment Thesis: 15% 
Investment is tightly coupled with innovation, and getting sustainable innovation to scale requires the infusion of capital from multiple sources. In this assignment, students approach sustainability from the perspective of an investor. Students will work in groups of their own choosing, and will form an investment strategy to deploy a fixed amount of capital to drive maximum impact in the sustainability domain where they most want to effect change. The end product will be an investment thesis with a prospective portfolio of companies, with justification for why those companies were selected tied back to the investment strategy. Emphasis will be placed on the key indicators and metrics that are being used to select the portfolio, acknowledging a need for both impact and financial performance. 

Investment Pitch: 15% 
For this assignment, students will summarize their investment thesis into a succinct presentation that clearly articulates their proposed investment strategy and example portfolio. Half of the class will present on the first presentation day and the other half of the class will present in the second. You will be evaluated on the clarity of your arguments and your responses to questions from the other half of the class, who will be the playing the role of mock investors that you would like to convince to invest in your fund. A portion of your grade on this assignment will be determined by the amount of capital you secure from the mock investors. 
Investment Memo: 10% 
On the day that your group is not presenting its investment memo, you will be playing the role of a mock investor, deciding in which investment fund(s) you would like to place your set amount of capital. As an investor, you will have the same amount of capital as your peers to allocate to whichever fund(s) you believe will achieve the greatest impact and financial returns. You will justify your decision in a short memo. 
Participation
Your participation grade considers your constructive involvement in class and your attendance. This is not a purely lecture-based course. Online discussion is a vital part of your learning experience. You will need to come to class prepared to discuss the day's case and readings and to respond to the ideas and comments of others. I expect your interactions to be well reasoned and respectful. No bystanders. Students will be expected to attend all classes. If you are unable to attend you will need to notify me of your absence in advance.",

Lab formats differ throughout the year as you work on developing your business model and prototype. Presentations may be executed in front of some or all of the teaching team who will provide constructive feedback based on real industry experience; or in front of the class who will provide peer perspective.
Mid-Term and Final Deliverables: These are major deliverables summarizing work completed at the end of each term. These deliverables relate to both the business and technical components of the venture and rely on the input and coordination of all team members.
Founder’s Agreement: Teams will be required to submit a Founder’s agreement Memorandum of Understanding as a prelude to a Founder’s Agreement.
Individual Reflection Assignment: The reflective diary is an opportunity to think introspectively. Drawing lessons from what was learned through the course, students should reflect on a cross-section of the topics taught and connect these with personal experience. Depth and breadth of reflective thinking should be evident in a diary. We recommend making notes weekly in a journal (best practices based on former students’ experience); however, the graded component is a final summary of what was learned from the entire course that is most useful as one looks forward as an entrepreneur and innovator. Students are meant to draw upon weekly entries for inspiration, and not cut and paste them. Don’t regurgitate what was taught. Reflect on what YOU learned and the impact that this has or will have.
Participation: This is an individual assessment. This is not a lecture-based course; therefore, classroom discussion and activities are a vital part of the learning experience. Treat class like a business meeting: phones on silent and put away; laptops are closed as a default and only opened when Professors request it; be on time; come fed or be willing to wait until after class to eat, etc. Participation is the grade that the Professors give each individual student based on their professionalism and constructive involvement in-class (during plenary and team discussions, in the activities, as well individual attitude, lateness, etc.). So, in short, participation are grades students earn by being a positive and constructive member of the community during class time (from the Professors’ perspective), and iPeer (see below- student’s perspective) may be used as evidence to deduct grades from a student’s overall course grade in the event of poor contribution to the team effort (such as free-riding) in and outside of class. Beyond in-class participation, active use of the Slack channel will also be assessed as part of the participation grades. Failure of the team to use the Slack channel actively will impact the participation grade of all team members. Where we have speakers in class, it is expected that students are prepared and interaction with guests will be evaluated as part of participation. Finally, Weekly Team summaries are recommended (see details on Canvas). APSC Design and Innovation (Day) Event: Students are required to present their project to the public during the APSC design and innovation event. The format will be determined by APSC.",

Students will be acquainted with the theory and empirical evidence concerning venture capital markets. The course will cover contracting, fundraising, and financing choice in depth, with the aim of catering to students looking to raise money for entrepreneurial ventures or invest in entrepreneurial ventures. ","The course will have several graded cases which will be worked on in small groups. 
All assignments are due by on the deadline posted online. 
Each case should be submitted on Canvas by one group member. If there is a problem with the online submission, you are required to email the completed assignment to me before the posted deadline. 
To ensure all students have equal access to information, all student questions on cases will be answered by email and the emails will be posted online. To ensure students who work on the case prior to the deadline are not at a disadvantage, case questions received less than 24 hours before the case due date will not be answered. 
Groups across sections will be allowed for some, but not all, cases.
You are prohibited from discussing group cases with people outside of your group until after the in-class discussion.
All assignments will be checked for plagiarism and cheating, which may involve the transmission of assignments to US web-servers.

There will be a final case. You are required to complete the case.
Participation: 15%
Your participation mark starts at 70%. Your grade will go up or down based on the following:
In-class discussion and exercises: Class discussion is an important part of the learning experience. You will earn marks by being a leader in class discussion and lose marks be being unprepared.
Guest Speakers: Impressing guest speakers is extremely important to me. You will lose significant amounts of marks by disrespecting guest speakers (electronics, skipping class, etc.) and earn significant amounts of marks by impressing them. I want every guest speaker to walk away thinking: ""Those students were amazing; I should hire one."" No external electronic devices are permitted on days with guest speakers.",

This course is designed for students interested in learning best practices used to develop new products and services and the factors that influence success and failure at each stage of development. The course is focused on industry best practices and is aimed at developing your ability as a manager and decision maker.,"Online pre-assessments are short quizzes that students complete on Canvas before the start of each class to ensure that everyone has read the assigned case or article for that day. This will ensure that everyone is prepared for class so that class time can be dedicated to higher-level discussion. Pre- assessments must be completed before the first live class or will receive a grade of zero.
Class Participation (10%):
Students are evaluated on participation in every class. Your participation grade is based entirely on the extent to which your contribution to class discussion impacts the learning of others. It is about your impact on the learning of others rather than the frequency of your participation. Asking an intriguing question or presenting your analysis is more impactful than simply answering a question. Respecting your classmates is paramount and I value quality over quantity.
Please note that it is class policy that all students must have their webcam turned on during all class sessions via Zoom. This fosters better communication, engagement, class cohesiveness and accountability. Students who do not turn on their webcam will receive a participation grade of zero for that class.
Grading Scale for Class Participation:
0 – Absent or late to class, or student video not on during Zoom sessions. 5 - Present but does not participate.
6 - Participates with basic information such as case facts.
7 – Offers an opinion or asks/answers a basic question.
8 – Engages in a meaningful discussion with other members of the class.
9 – Shares an analysis using data or evidence from the case or reading.
10 – Provides insight or asks a question that is instrumental in advancing understanding.
Case Submission (30%)
The case submission is a comprehensive case dealing with the concepts and best practices that we address throughout the course. You will be asked to answer a number of specific questions that require you to analyze several aspects of the case and make a decision. The case and questions will be posted on Canvas. The case submission is an individual assignment. You may not consult with your classmates or any other individuals. We will discuss the case in class. Consequently, late submissions cannot be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Team Project Part 1: Market Opportunity Report (20%)
Students will be randomly assigned to teams and will apply the opportunity identification techniques learned in the course. The goal is to identify a set of market needs that will drive the design of the product/service concept submitted at the end of the course. Reports will be graded on the appropriateness and execution of the techniques employed, the team’s understanding of relevant concepts, the depth and appropriateness of the analysis, the clarity of the report, the attractiveness of the market opportunity, and the market potential of the need area. There is no defined page limit but 10-15 pages is a reasonable target. Please refer to the class schedule for the submission deadline. Late submissions will be penalized one letter grade for each 24-hour period beyond the deadline.
Team Project Part 2: Concept Proposal (20%)
Part 2 of the team project involves developing a new product or service concept that satisfies the market needs identified in Part I of the project. The proposal will (1) describe how the concepts identified in Part I were evaluated, prioritized, and screened (2) identify the benefits/characteristics that the design aims to maximize, (3) identify the trade-offs that existed and how trade-off decisions were made when optimizing the design, and (4) argue why the new concept should be pursued and outline the key risk factors that could affect successful development and market acceptance.
Reports will be graded on the appropriateness and execution of trade-off decisions, the team’s understanding of relevant concepts, the depth and appropriateness of the analysis, the clarity of the report, and the market potential of the proposed product/service. There is no defined page limit but 15- 20 pages is a reasonable target. Guidelines for the report will be distributed in class. Refer to the class schedule for the submission deadline. Late submissions will be penalized one letter grade for each 24- hour period beyond the deadline.
Team Project Part 2: Concept Presentation (10%)
Each team will deliver a 20-minute presentation to the class pitching your new product/service concept. The presentation will be followed by a 10-minute Q&A period with the class. The format of your presentation is up to you and your team members, but it should be professional and involve each member of your team. Presentations will be held in the last four classes of the semester. Presentation dates for each team will be determined by a random draw (see course schedule for possible dates).
All class members must attend the final presentations of all teams. Failure to attend will result in a 10% deduction from the student’s final grade. Presentation grades will be determined by the mean score your team receives from the class. The class will evaluate your team’s performance using the Presentation Evaluation Sheet at the end of this course outline. Your team should review the evaluation criteria listed on the Presentation Evaluation Sheet when developing your presentation.",

Social entrepreneurs are distinctive in their focus on a social mission as the primary, driving force of their organization. Traditional business performance measures – such as growth and profit – are relevant and important to social entrepreneurs, but not as standalone outcomes; rather, the value of growth and profit is manifested in the organization’s ability to achieve its social mission more quickly and effectively.
Social entrepreneurs see opportunity in the blurring of the traditionally separate roles of governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies. Social ventures can take a wide variety of forms ranging from non-profit to for-profit – and countless innovative hybrids in between.","Social Problem Situational Analysis, Selected Case Study + Team Presentation, Applied Social Enterprise Team Project, Reflection Paper Online Pre-assessments – 10%

Course Outline
With the goal of providing a more active learning experience during our time together, students will complete regular online pre-assessments to guide their class preparation. Such preparation will ensure class time can be dedicated to higher-level application of and interaction with key concepts, tools, and discussions.
Assignment 1 (Partners): Social Problem Situational Analysis – 20%
The purpose of a situational analysis written assignment is to help increase knowledge about the context of a social problem, identified and selected by the students. The selected problem may be local, national, global or specific to another country. With this in mind, it is important to understand the context and system of which the problem is a part, as well as the circumstances and influences that may have resulted in the situation. This type of exercise is essential to developing a deeper understanding of how any proposed future recommendations or initiatives might impact all communities and stakeholders.
In preparing the situational analysis please reference appropriate sources (literature and reports) and interpret and apply findings to regional issues (i.e. nutrition, health, education, the economy, environmental sustainability, etc.). This macro level background information will provide an important contextual backdrop. Elements of the situational analysis may include:
• Background ~ brief description of the situation in the region (i.e. country, province/state, city, etc.) in terms of economy, climate, political structure, religion, gender and other factors that could have an impact on the problem space you are exploring. Consider regional differences and particularities.
• Issue Status ~ research and statistics about the relevant issues.
• Causes of Issues ~ summary of factors (i.e. historical, political, cultural, climatic, etc.) that might be
contributing to the current state of affairs relating to the current situation.
• Current Key Intervention Strategies ~ brief analysis of strategies that are currently being implemented
to address the issues, including why the strategies may have been selected (consider appropriateness
from a cultural and national perspective). What might be some of the challenges with these strategies?
• Resources ~ references clearly indicated for all sources used.
Assignment 2 (Teams): Selected Case Study + Team Presentation – 15%*
The purpose of this assignment is to allow students to learn about what social entrepreneurs have done or are doing globally to address systemic issues that they have identified. By researching and understanding best practices and “failures”, students will gain an understanding of the challenges and successes that social entrepreneurs experience in establishing social ventures. Assignment 3 (Teams): Applied Social Enterprise Team Project – 30%*
One of the most effective ways to integrate and synthesize course concepts is to apply them in real practice. The Applied Social Enterprise Project is a defined assignment for which students will conduct research and develop focused recommendations for a local social venture facing real business opportunities and challenges. This project is the main, “hands-on” element of the course that will allow students to integrate and apply the course concepts to benefit real organizations. Working in teams, students will have the opportunity to work on at least one specific applied project, as identified by the participating partner organization.
Final deliverables for this major team project will include a concise written report describing the team’s research, analysis and recommendations, as well as a brief presentation of the highlights. (Note: In some circumstances, the partner organization may request a team to present to the organization’s larger team.)
* Individual grades on team assignments may be subject to adjustment based on instructor and iPeer evaluations.
Assignment 4 (Individual): Reflection Paper – 10%
Social entrepreneurship is a rapidly growing and evolving field with a vast array of definitions, forms, and applications around the world. Students will be encouraged to reflect on and explore more deeply the topics and cases that interest them during the semester. Students will be asked to write a reflective paper (“memo”) to share their individual insights arising from their experiences and their growing knowledge of the social enterprise field.",
,COMM 486G / BAEN 510,Intrapreneurship,"•	Design a complete corporate entrepreneurship program from the ground up. 
•	Assess the factors that are advantages or obstacles to intrapreneurship in varied organizational structures and cultures. 
•	Apply intrapreneurial best practices to innovation projects, ventures and social impact intrapreneurship inside existing organizations.","The entrepreneurially-minded can choose from several career paths: work for a company to gain experience, create their own startup venture, or become an innovator in an existing organization.  There are many advantages to innovating inside a large company. This course is designed for intrapreneurs who intend to apply their entrepreneurial spirit to innovating within established organizations.  
The course sets the stage for intrapreneurship by looking at intrapreneurially driven corporate innovation strategies outside of the normal R&D process.   You will learn how to leverage the innovation advantages existing organizations have over start-ups.  You will learn about your own “innovator’s DNA” and intrapreneurial best practices that combine disruptive innovation strategies, start-up thinking and entrepreneurial methods to accomplish organizational innovation in its many forms, from product/service innovation and business model innovation, to impact intrapreneurship for social and environmental purposes.  You will also take the role of a senior executive, by designing your own complete corporate venturing program to build disruptive innovation into your large company.     
This course is a complement to other courses in the entrepreneurship and innovation track.  It is also a standalone course for students in other tracks who are interested in driving innovation in existing organizations.This course develops student abilities to plan and execute on intrapreneurial initiatives in existing organizations, both as an intrapreneur, and as senior management building corporate entrepreneurship into the organization.","Assignments, Team Project Intrapreneurship in organizations is not a solo activity, and that reality is reflected in the team nature of much of the work in this course.  The course is participative and activity-based, and operates much like a real management team environment.  Like a real business, it requires engagement for success.  
Assessment of participation will be based on attendance at classes and the level of participation quality. Consider the class as a management meeting where you contribute your relevant experience, insights, and questions.  Quality pertains to the relevance, insight and clarity of your remarks, questions, and presentations.   Participation that would be judged well in a management team environment will earn high participation grades in class. 
Individual assignments will consist of assigned cases or scenarios.  Assignments may be a combination of individual written submissions, and group presentations in class.  Further details will be provided in class.
The team project:  teams select a real-world organization and, using intrapreneurial principles, prepare a compelling proposal for a disruptive product or service that the organization should commercialize.  The team will present their intrapreneurial idea in a competition to convince senior management to fund it.  Students will be encouraged to propose intrapreneurial projects for organizations they are or have been involved with. 
Alternatively, teams may choose to design a complete and coherent corporate intrapreneurial program, for a real company of their choice.  The intrapreneurial program will include all the necessary elements to make it successful, such as a mission statement, idea generation/collection process, evaluation processes, incubation and training, and of course creating a brand for the program.  The team will present their program to convince senior management to fund it.  
As would be the case in the business world, the team will be assessed on the quality and completeness of the analysis, the team’s ability to communicate it, and how compelling and feasible the proposal is.",

They will know how to negotiate terms sheets and how to prioritize contractual clauses. Finally, they will be able to make recommendations on fundraising strategies for both entrepreneurs and venture capital firms.","Entrepreneurs have changed the world over the last four decades. There are now many forms of finance available from angels and venture capital to government programs and many others. These sources of funding have become an important segment of the financial system, and the economy at large. In this course we will look at financing for privately-held companies, particularly startup companies from the perspective of the entrepreneur and the investor.
In this class students will learn about the main challenges faced by entrepreneurs and investors, particularly venture capital practitioners, taking sometimes the entrepreneur’s perspective, sometimes switching to the perspective of the venture capitalist. Students will become familiar with the terminology and institutional background of the industry, and learn to understand the underlying economic issues. While this course does not aim to provide a comprehensive treatment of financial valuation techniques, it will discuss many of the financial trade-offs that arise that the entrepreneur needs to understand in the context of venture capital deals, both in terms of valuation and contractual structures. It will also relate these financial trade-offs to the broader strategic decisions made by entrepreneurs and venture capital investors.
In summary, the purpose of this course is
1. To introduce students to the topics of entrepreneurial finance and venture capital.
2. To expose students to the variety of challenges faced by different types of entrepreneurs, in the
process of seeking funding for their entrepreneurial ventures.

alternative perspectives that aim to understand the financing challenges of entrepreneurial
companies and their venture investors.
4. To introduce decision making around structuring startups with founders and funding.
5. To consider decisions faced by entrepreneurs around exiting companies.","Assessments of class participation will be based on the level of quality participation. Attendance at classes is not sufficient to achieve marks for participation. Active discussion will be expected and graded.
Class assignments consist of writing a 2-page memo that discusses the assignment questions for each of the 5 cases that will be discussed in this course. When appropriate, students are encouraged to include spreadsheets with their calculations. Each assignment is worth 6 points, unless otherwise noted, and the total number of points for assignments is capped at 30 points.
Assessment of the final presentations will be based on the performance on the day of presentation, as judged by the attending venture capitalist and the professor. This will be a group grade, although points will also be allocated based on individual contribution. Team Project
This course includes a novel team project that involves a unique cooperation between course participants, and one of the leading Canadian venture capital firms: Chrysalix (http://www.chrysalix.com). Student teams will be provided an option of undertaking one of two assignments:
 Investment Decision: You will be provided access to “real world” business plans of entrepreneurs seeking venture capital financing. The objective of the project is for student teams to experience the entire process of selecting investment opportunities, performing due diligence, and making an investment recommendation to the senior partners of a venture capital firm; or
 Exit Analysis: You will be provided access to “real world” business plans for portfolio companies that already exist in a venture firm. You will be asked to analyze how you would monetize the company and what value the investor could expect from an exit.
Due to the confidential nature of the information provided by Chrysalix, students are not allowed to make direct contact with the companies that they are evaluating. They are encouraged to perform a due diligence analysis of the company, its competitors, and its industry, but should never disclose the identity of the company that they are researching.
We will set aside a little bit of class time to discuss the investment evaluation exercise, but much of the additional work will happen outside of class time. Teams will need to meet on a regular basis. In addition, there is a presentation that will be made in front of Chrysalix partners. Note that the final presentation is scheduled outside of regular class time, on Monday April 8th in the evening (6-9pm).
Investment Decision
For those choosing the investment project, the presentations will have to address two major areas: First, the “investment selection.” Teams will present their preliminary evaluation of all the business plans. They will also need to justify their top three choices, and in particular the one that they selected for the second part of the project, in depth analysis.
The second part of the presentation will then be an “investment proposals.” Teams will present an in- depth analysis of their selected business plan, and propose a complete investment structure for funding the company and a recommendation valuation and investment terms. Finally, teams will be required to make a recommendation on whether the company should be funded or not.
Exit Analysis
For those choosing the exit analysis, the presentation will have to address two major areas. The first part of the presentation needs to address what is the most likely exit path for this company, considering the case for both an IPO and an acquisition. In considering an acquisition scenario do your own research as to the potential acquirers, the alternative acquirers, why these acquirers might be interest. Then consider whether an IPO might be more or less attractive.",

Climate change re- quires businesses, households, and governments to respond to this challenge through mitigation of carbon emissions and adaptation to a changing environment. Govern- ments are developing a multitude of economic policy interventions to facilitate mitiga- tion and adaptation, and businesses are responding by reducing their carbon footprint but also by developing new solutions. Climate change has also created novel markets for climate solutions through innovation. Renewable energy sources are first among them, as displacing fossil fuels is critical for achieving climate action goals. Decarbonization across the many sectors of the economy poses numerous additional challenges and obstacles—as well as new market opportunities.
This course explores how economic principles shape environmental policy and market solutions for climate change. The first part of the course focuses on government policy on climate change, and the second part of the course focuses on solutions and markets that are developing in response to climate change. The course will answer key questions including:
1. Howdoesclimatescienceinformclimateeconomicsandclimatepolicies,andthe allocation of resources between climate mitigation and climate adaptation?
2. How do different climate policies compare across different metrics? What are the trade-offs that governments consider when designing environmental policies?
3. How do policy instruments affect businesses? What is their optimal response es-
pecially when they are engaged in international trade?
4. What are the economic challenges to developing more renewable energy sources
and displacing fossil fuels, and integrating renewable energy sources into our elec- tricity grids while electricity demand is increasing along with the rapid electrifica- tion of mobility?    5. What are specific climate solutions for different industrial sectors and markets— including electric utilities, oil&gas producers, transportation (cars, planes, ships), and emission-intensive producers such as steel and cement?
6. Which economic forces will shape the course of innovation? Which novel tech- nologies are on the horizon to solve major obstacles (e.g., hydrogen & electricity storage, carbon capture and storage)?

You can identify more than three traps, but your analysis of each trap should be thorough and offer examples and context. Where appropriate, you should conduct background research and provide citations. In addition to the one-page memo, you are allowed a one-page appendix, as well as whatever space is required for references.  
Memo: Sustainability at Scale: The purpose of this assignment is for students to identify and describe a sustainability initiative that has been adopted at a large scale. This means that product-market fit has  been well-established, there’s no technology risk, and that a large organization (think Nike, Nestle, IKEA, etc.) has adopted and implemented the chosen initiative.
You need to write a one-page, single-spaced memo. It should briefly summarize the initiative, identity the problem it addresses, and build a compelling business case for why this initiative is of high value. Significant background research is expected, and students should not rely on press releases or corporate reports – find external validation (if possible) of all the claims being made. The best practices of writing a business memo are expected: jargon-free, descriptive headings, professional formatting, and the selective and appropriate use of visual elements.  In addition to the one-page memo, you are allowed a one-page appendix, as well as whatever space is required for references.  
Memo: Disruptive Sustainability: The purpose of this assignment is for students to identify and describe a sustainability innovation that contains massive disruptive potential. This might be a technology, business model, or even a social movement that could radically alter the status quo. The chosen initiative might still be in its early stages and significant risk and uncertainty likely remains. This also means that background research is going to be more difficult - you may have to dig deep, and find creative ways to validate (or offer skepticism) about some of the claims being made. ",

Creative leaders have the ability to innovate, problem-solve and generate new ideas (independently and collectively) that inspire change and action. Creativity is often misunderstood as an inherent talent, when in fact, it is a discipline that can be learned and sharpened. Creativity involves a process of turning new, imaginative ideas into reality, and requires persistent and deliberate practice. This five-day intensive course will challenge you to develop (or reclaim) your professional creative confidence. Through a combination of lectures, podcasts, videos, and immersive in-class activities, you will learn to see business problems and opportunities in new ways and develop solutions unseen and unimagined by others. This foundational course provides you with key principles, prompts and practices to foster individual creativity and ways to apply them in teams and in business. As managers and future leaders, discover how creativity is a force for important and impactful change.

","Summary:
         Interview Write-Up= 25%
         Business Model Canvas = 10%
         Final Report = 35%
         Final Pitch (Pitch Deck: 10% & Presentation: 10%) = 20%
         Class Participation = 10%
Interview Write-Up: Each student (or pair of students) will come up with an idea for a business. They will identify assumptions and create hypotheses critical to the ventures success. Each student must conduct a series of relevant interviews to validate these assumptions. The write-up will be a synthesis of these interviews.
Business Model Canvas: Students will complete the business model canvas using three different market segments and justify one to use for the rest of the term.
Final Report: A detailed report of the proposed venture including all of the components covered in class as well as a discussion on risks and mitigation.
Final Pitch: Each student will do a 3-minute pitch of their idea to the class. Students will also submit their pitch deck for grading.
Class Participation: This is not a lecture-based course. Classroom discussion is a vital part of your learning experience. You will need to come to class prepared to discuss the day's case and readings and to respond to the ideas and comments of others. I expect your interactions to be informative, well-reasoned and respectful. No bystanders. ",
