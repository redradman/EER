The application deadline is  November 19th at 11:59  PM  PST, and the program will start in  February 2024. Frequently  Asked  Questions  What is the difference between  Lab2 Launch and  Lab2 Market  Validate? There’s no expectation on  L2 M applicants that they will pursue commercialization of their  IP, or found a startup.  We expect our  L2 L applicants to commit to pursuing a venture and we screen applicants based on this commitment. L2 M involves a single applicant/participant, a grad student inventor, whereas  L2 L requires a committed founding team. The “customer discovery” in  L2 M is focused on establishing if there is evidence for market potential.  The point of  L2 M is to shift the scientific focus from the technology to the users and their needs.  L2 L goes far beyond evaluating a market opportunity to get the founding team thinking about their ecosystem in its entirety and to consider how they are going to build a viable business. Eligibility: Do  I need to be affiliated with  SFU or  UBC, given they are the program delivery partners? No - the programs are open to eligible researchers across  BC for the  Regional  Cohort, and across the country for the  Health  Cohort Do  I need to be a student with a university in  British  Columbia? You must be a current graduate or postdoc researcher, or recent graduate program alumni (within 2 years) eligible for  Mitacs funding with any university in  BC (regional cohort) or across  Canada ( Health cohort). Can  I apply to both streams? No, please select the best fit for your innovation/technology. What do you mean by  Industry  Agnostic? In the context of this program,  Industry  Agnostic refers to any industry not related to  Health  Sciences.  Health  Science applicants must apply to the  Health  Sciences stream.

Since then,  SEC has engaged thousands of students and grown to an inter-faculty club that seeks to bridge disciplines, unite students and social enterprise, and create changemakers.  Our  Goals  We strive to create a lasting impact on campus by educating, empowering and inspiring students to become catalysts for sustainable positive change and think of creative answers to the social issues that have gone unaddressed in our world.  We aim to cultivate a community that dares to challenge the status quo, exceed expectations, and create systemic impact.  What is  Social  Enterprise  We define a social enterprise as an organization that cares about more than just profit, but rather one that innovates on business models to achieve a triple bottom line: profit to be re-invested in social good, social impact, and environmental impact.  Social entrepreneurs are drivers of this change that disrupts the status quo and transforms our world.  We  Bridge  Disciplines  We believe you can’t form a business with just business students and that everyone has the ability to create an immense change in the world.  We also know that connecting diverse skill-sets is very powerful for social innovation and therefore put a great emphasis on “bridging disciplines” and bringing students from all faculties together.  We  Unite  Students and  Social  Enterprise  We are strong believers that social entrepreneurship is not simply a profession – but also a mindset.  The students of  UBC are tomorrow’s leaders and we strive to facilitate the engagement of students with entrepreneurs and concepts in the social enterprise field.  We provide a diverse range of opportunities for students of all faculties to get involved and explore how they can drive change and be socially innovative throughout their career, whatever their career may be.  We  Create  Changemakers  SEC imagines a world where business is used as a tool for social good, for making a sustainable impact, and for ultimately creating a better world.  We imagine a world built on trust and dignity, one that values communities over compensation and one in which innovation stems from the promise of doing good.  Our goal is to accelerate the growth of the changemaker network at  UBC and to encourage all students to consider the power they have to make a difference.  Want  To  Get  Involved?

By the end of the program, all students showcase and celebrate their work at  Enspire  Day, our annual flagship event.  Seeder is an initiative that is dedicated to mitigating and diverting food waste in the  Lower  Mainland while tackling food insecurity.  We facilitate the donation of excess food from organizations and food retailers to  UBC distribution sites, where the food is given to students facing food insecurity.  This year, we plan on further tackling the issue of food waste by expanding outside of  UBC and helping food-insecure residents in the  Lower  Mainland.  We are also planning innovative ways to use upcycled organics to empower organizations in the environmental sector and inspire students to create change in their communities. Founded in 2022 and launched in 2023,  Building  Bridges aims to bridge the knowledge gap in today’s academic curriculum about  Indigenous history and mobilize non- Indigenous youth to take action through social entrepreneurship.  Through interactive workshops, modules and a final conference, we educate on topics such as the history of settler colonialism,  Indigenous history, and  Indigenous rights.  Currently, we are preparing to formally launch our program in high schools this upcoming  September. Email Facebook Instagram Linked In©  Enactus  UBCGet in  Touch!

The high school entrepreneurs’ program was delivered at 5 high schools and mentorship was provided to 102 high school students up until the discontinuation of the program in 2018  In 2020  Summit  Leaders was acquired by  Rina  Lamba.  Rina, a recent  Graduate at the time, from the  Schulich  School of  Business (’19) participated in the  Summit  Leaders program during her studies at  Schulich where she provided mentorship to grade 11 marketing students at  C. W.  Jefferys  Collegiate  Institute.  Rina branded the  High  School  Entrepreneurship  Program as a  Summit  Leaders  Program.  During the  COVID-19 response, she adapted and delivered a virtual program that was delivered to high school students in the  GTA.  Since 2015 the program has been offered to over 300  High  School  Students.  What we do  Our not-for-profit organization levels the playing field for youth from marginalized communities by leveraging the power of connection to build community, nurture aspirations, and dismantle barriers to help create a more equitable society.  We achieve this by placing our emphasis on expanding student networks through facilitating connections with professionals and enhancing visibility to future opportunities.  According to  Robert  Waldinger, 50% of job opportunities arise from personal connections.  Recognizing the evolving nature of the modern job market, we acknowledge that building a successful career relies not only on skills and knowledge, but also on the ability to access networks and foster relationships.  By actively facilitating connections, we empower students to overcome obstacles, boost their confidence, and unlock their untapped potential.  This is the essence of our approach to connectivity.  We establish a direct line of communication between students and industry experts, enabling them to cultivate relationships through engaging conversations, knowledge exchange, and valuable feedback.  Through a series of targeted programs, such as  Summit  Leaders  High  School  Entrepreneurship  Program,  Peer  Forward and  Inspire Connect our goal is simple: provide greater impact through individualized support to  Canada’s next generation leaders.  A structured approach allows students from across  Canada to receive mentorship, build connections, develop a business idea, and a business case.  The world of business administration and entrepreneurship becomes an option – a goal, an aspiration.  As they soak up real-world business expertise, our students also discover more about themselves – about skills they never knew they had or thought they might never get to use.  They refine and reset personal and career goals.  Most importantly, we help them open doors to new possibilities and see the future in a different light.

Learning is student-led.  It is more of an idea nurturing and actualizing as opposed to normal educational learning.

It has made me appreciate the business from an entrepreneur and customer point of view.”  Dorcas  Odhiambo ( Spring  Class of 2021),  Sparklin  Pro  Cleaning  Services | atienoodhiambo16@gmail.com "" LIFT has been the best thing that has happened in my life as an entrepreneur.  I am so grateful to  God that  I was a part of it.  I learned so much from the program; lessons that  I am going to incorporate as  I start my business in a few week's time.  My favorite moment was when we had an actual graduation ceremony and received our certificates.  It was a great honor and the fact that they retained  LIFT alumni as service providers was so great to see.  To me, it means that  LIFT will always be there for you.""  Some of whom have taken the lead on giving back to the UBC  Sauder  LIFT program through serving as  Trainers  Trainers play a multifunctional role.  During in-person classes,  Trainer's act to bridge knowledge gaps between teaching material and a participant’s understanding of classroom concepts, generate classroom discussions during breakout activities, and identify participants to present their ideas.  Similarly, during live cases,  Trainers will encourage problem solving skills and engagement.  Lastly, during pitch day,  Trainers are responsible for ensuring participants are ready to present to judges in a timely manner.  Trainees  Trainees will play a dual-role in which they will be equal parts teachers and observers.  Trainees will be expected to aid  Trainers in facilitating discussion and guide participants during classroom breakout activities.  Observer  Observers will be selected from previous  LIFT  Program participants.  The main role of an  Observer is to take on a shadow position, in order to learn from  Trainers and  Trainees.  Observers will monitor the classroom environment and alert  Trainers or  Trainees of concerns or questions they may have.  Quote from a  Trainee  Mourine  Uchi ( Spring  Class of 2021),  Mo  Online  Store | maureenuchi97@gmail.com  Mourine began as a student during the spring class of 2021 and became a  Trainee in the fall class of 2021. "" Throughout my own life,  I've had mentors who have molded me into the person  I am today.  I believe there are others like me, who dream to own their own online stores.

Student  Experience  Lift  Learning  Cycle  Meet  Our  Team  Our  Impact  Our  Partners  Student  Experience  Current students  Student experience  Highlights and insight from some of  UBC  Sauder  LIFT:  Kenya (formerly  SSE- Kenya) scroll_arrow  Accelerated learning  The program was like an incubator, since it accelerated so much learning in a short period of time for both myself and for the participants.  As a naturally risk-averse person,  I found  I was pushed to step outside of my comfort zone, whether that was through day-to-day teaching, interactions with my peers and participants, or participation in the extracurricular activities.  Chelsea  Choi,  BCom 2019  Mutual respect  My age did not restrict my experiences or involvement within the program.  I was never regarded by my team as simply a first-year student.  Rather,  I felt that my opinions and ideas were just as valued as those of older team members.  At first,  I figured that working in a country which was foreign to everyone is what leveled the playing field.  Although this was true to some degree,  I came to realize that it was a mutual respect between  Sauder team members that made us all equal.  Emielia  Dahl- Sam,  BCom 2021  Deep connections  Within the first week of teaching, students had already started asking questions for the sake of asking and creating some friendly banter.  It was amazing to see such friendliness even though many of them had only met for the first time.  All of my deepest connections with participants from the program were all started with a simple, “ How are you?”  Simon  Chow,  BCom 2020  Supportive community  It didn’t take me long to see the incredible characters of our team.  I was with people who worked hard—their motivation was contagious.  I knew in all situations that my teammates would be there to cheer me on, lend a helping hand, and push me to improve.  Being surrounded by these people helped change my mindset on what  I am capable of.  Brielle  Man,  BCom 2020  Empowerment  I initially felt skeptical of the impact we could make: according to some  Mathare community leaders, their top needs include more space and resources, such as extra computers, but not necessarily volunteers from  North  America.  As time progressed,  I saw the true impact of the program in  Nairobi.  We weren’t there to “give.”  We were there to share knowledge, to empower these youths to sustain their own lives, families, and communities so that they could reach their potential.  Maggie  Yip,  BCom 2020  Innovation and impact  Social entrepreneurship was a pre-existing concept for the  Kenyan students—regardless of their personal or financial situation, many of their business ideas had an underlying mission to bring about social impact in their community.  One of my students,  Susan, hopes to set up a laboratory to provide proper training to students for testing chemicals, as well as work with local farmers to conduct soil testing and give recommendations on the nutrients and fertilizers needed.  Her vision is to one day convert the contaminated water in the  Mathare  River into a clean water source through various chemical analysis.  It was both truly rewarding and inspiring to work with students like  Susan and help turn an idea into a business plan by teaching business tools, mentoring her one-on-one, and seeing her pitch in front of 15 community partners.  Marian  Lee,  BCom 2020  Inspiration  A pivotal moment of my program experience was at the end of the second day of class, on  June 6th, when three students— Christopher,  Martin, and  John—proudly showed off their products.  Chris provided lighting for  Mathare homeowners through installing plastic bottles in their tin roofs,  Martin made tin lamps, and  John made decorations/protection for water bottles.  Not only were they not the only ones in class with established businesses (about 40% of our class already had their own business running), but it wasn’t even their main product/service.  It was what they called a “side hustle.” “ In  Mathare,”  Martin said, “it is necessary to have to work many different jobs.”  That moment inspired me.  I wanted to work even harder to deliver effective business lessons so our class could have a better  ROI on their “working time.”  Seeing the high work ethic, grit, and drive of my students, in juxtaposition to their living conditions, changed my perspective.  The program was humbling—it made me reconsider my privilege and feelings of entitlement.  Getting to know the students and their stories and dreams cemented the point that behind any success is the encouragement provided by many people along the way.

At  Engineers  Without  Borders  Canada, we recognize that technology alone can’t drive real and lasting change.  True progress requires a holistic approach, considering cultural, behavioral, and political factors.  We value insights from those who understand these issues, and believe that they are key to effective solutions.  We share the tech community’s vision: technology should uplift people and the planet.  With this ethos, we leverage engineering and technology to create a more equitable and sustainable future.  Join us in making engineered technology a force for good – for people, and for the planet.  Our vision is to engineer an equitable and sustainable future for marginalized people and the planet. 10%  Annual increases in aid we're challenging the government to commit to.  Our mission is to create systemic change through community-driven collaboration.  We mobilize the engineering community and leverage technological innovation to address urgent and important global challenges, both within  Canada and beyond.  Engineering for change.  The influence of engineering and technological advances in our everyday day lives is pervasive, often taken for granted.  Yet a significant portion of the global population remains excluded from these advantages, sometimes deliberately.  Our extensive experience in global development has revealed that relying solely on technological ‘fixes’ falls short.  Achieving meaningful change requires a comprehensive approach, encompassing cultural, behavioral, and political systems while valuing input from those directly affected.  At  Engineers  Without  Borders  Canada, we believe that socially-engaged engineers and technologists aim to transcend profit and recognition, and wish to focus on enhancing the lives of the many, without harming the planet’s ecosystems.  Our commitment is to leverage engineering and technology to create a more equitable world and improve lives while safeguarding our planet’s vital systems.  Join us in championing technology for the greater good.  Our strategy:  Strategic  Goals for 2024-2029  Engineers  Without  Borders  Canada strives for a future where technological solutions lead to equitable and sustainable advancements, especially for marginalized communities.  EWB’s vision revolves around our strategic goals:  Goal 1:  Optimizing  Engineering  Solutions for  Global  Impact  At  Engineers  Without  Borders  Canada, our first goal is optimization.  We focus our efforts on addressing urgent and important global challenges where engineering can drive significant change.  Our approach incorporates scientific knowledge and engineering principles to create practical solutions that enhance well-being.  Beyond working on these challenges, we act as super-connectors, coordinators, and managers, uniting partners at various levels.  We concentrate on long-term development solutions, tackling critical issues such as climate change mitigation, decarbonization, resilient post-humanitarian engineering, sustainable infrastructure, and technologies for improved health, education, and employment opportunities.  Our commitment extends to identifying key policy levers and employing systems thinking to craft socially impactful solutions.  Goal 2:  Innovating with  Engineering  Expertise for  Global  Development  In our second goal, innovation takes center stage as we leverage evolving engineering and technological knowledge for global development.  We harness the strength of  EWB  University and  Technical  Institute  Student  Chapters in  Canada and beyond, attracting and deploying the expertise of socially-engaged engineers and technologists.  Collaborating with universities, technical institutes, and research centers in specific fields of  Engineering &  Technology is fundamental to our approach.  Active engagement with  Canadian engineering, technology, and resource sectors, along with associations, helps repurpose products and services to enhance well-being, reduce inequities, and protect ecosystems.  Goal 3:  Localized  Partnerships for  Sustainable  Solutions  Localization emphasizes partnerships, collaboration, and local ownership.  We prioritize working closely with key local stakeholders, including government ministries, universities, businesses, and communities.  Our approach rejects the notion of imposing solutions and instead advocates co-development through a localization-centered inclusive strategy, forming the core of our  International  Fellowships.  We aim to ensure that our efforts align precisely with local needs and priorities, with active participation from local communities, especially from those who are least heard.  Our empowerment strategies encompass diverse approaches, including decision-making power, capacity-building, community involvement, and self-determination.  Engineers  Without  Borders  Canada aspires to be a leader in promoting best practices for localization within the international development landscape.  Goal 4:  Advocacy –  Engineering  Change for a  Sustainable  World  Our fourth goal revolves around advocacy, as we aim to become the conduit and voice for  Canada’s socially engaged engineers and technologists and those who support them.  We passionately advocate for policy changes and systemic interventions on local, national, and international levels to effectively address global challenges.  Our strategy involves identifying and prioritizing engineering and technology-focused advocacy efforts, engaging public figures, and targeting substantial policy victories periodically and consistently.  We are committed to creating inclusive spaces where diverse experiences, perspectives, and knowledge converge.  Actively seeking and amplifying the voices of historically marginalized individuals and fostering cross-sectoral, multi-disciplinary participation are integral to our advocacy efforts, including engineers, technologists, and other socially-engaged communities.  Through advocacy, we strive to develop solutions that authentically reflect the diverse needs of society in our complex and interconnected world.  Join us in the steps we’re taking towards creating an equitable and sustainable world for all, harnessing the power of engineering.

From a weekly meeting to the world  With humble beginnings and a bi-weekly meeting in  George’s parents’ living room, the dream slowly grew into reality.  By the end of the year 2000, the initiative was supported by over 1000 members and a handful of chapters around the country.  In 2001, our first volunteer left for a four-month internship in  India.  By the end of the year 2000, the initiative was supported by over 1000 members.  Early beginnings  From a scribble on a napkin in a coffee shop, to the blueprint for systemic change around the world.  In the year 2000,  George  Roter and  Parker  Mitchell dreamt of an organization to harness the untapped potential of innovative and impassioned engineers. 2002  What do communities need?  Bunker  Roy on a better approach:  We needed to begin by asking not 'what do we bring?', but instead, 'what do communities need?'  It was only through answering this second question that we could begin to understand our role.  Changing focus at our first  National  Conference  Bunker  Roy, founder of the  Barefoot  Colleges — a voluntary organization working in the fields of education, skill development, health, drinking water, women's empowerment and more — delivered a strong dose of humility at our first ever  National  Conference in  Montreal.  Unlearning our approach meant focusing less on engineering technology, and serving the specific needs of communities.  The importance of 'unlearning'  Engineers  Without  Borders has always adopted a different approach.  In 2002, our organization learned a foundational lesson — by doing the exact opposite: 'unlearning'. 2003  At the end of the day, all we do is work for  Dorothy.  We work in the service of something — someone — else.  Something greater.'  Parker  Mitchell: ' By talking about  Dorothy, we don't mean to oversimplify.  There are 900 million people in  Sub- Saharan  Africa, and we aren't working with all of them, and there isn't one person who represents all of them.  But we wanted to have a person to remind us of who we are working for.  Someone to remind us that  EWB doesn't exist to work for our members' interests. ""...we wanted to have a person to remind us of who we are working for.""  An important focal point  From that point on,  Dorothy became a focal point; our most important stakeholder, an embodiment of our motivations, and a source of ongoing inspiration.  Introducing  Dorothy  At the second  National  Conference,  Parker  Mitchell introduced ‘ Dorothy’.  An  HIV/ AIDS worker from  Zambia,  Dorothy has become a singular distillation of the importance of our work. 2003  You can change the world with your voice.  Let me repeat that — you can change the world with your voice.  Question, clarify, explore, improve  Discussion, interrogation and feedback are encouraged to clarify the action and direction of our organization.  A growing culture  These questions prompted introspection; they still echo around our strategies today.  Since  James’ valuable examination, a large part of our work and culture has been to:  Embrace dilemmas.  Encourage debate.  Develop a voice and be vocal. ' What is your vision?  What is your action?  What is your voice?  If you are doing your job right, you will face these questions and you will see them as dilemmas.'  James  Orbinski offers a valuable interrogation  James  Orbinski —  Canadian physician, writer and humanitarian activist — offered a valuable reality check.  At our second  National  Conference, he questioned our organization: 2004  Whether you change or not, we are going to make it happen.  We will untie  Canada's aid.  It's not a matter of if... it's a matter of when.  Untying 'tied aid'  Tied aid required the recipients of  Canada’s foreign aid to purchase exclusively  Canadian goods and services – ultimately benefitting  Canadian companies and wasting aid money.  Between 2004 and 2008, hundreds of  EWB members took part in campaigning efforts.  These included initiatives to:  Engage the  Minister of  International  Cooperation to ask about tied aid.  Take to the streets of  Montreal for outreach events.  Sign and deliver cards to every  MP across  Canada.  Read more about the campaign  More information  Campaigning for change  In 2004, we began a four year campaign lobbying the  Canadian government to untie  Canada’s development aid. 2008  Campaigning comes to fruition.  The power of community  As a result of 2008, our ongoing advocacy work leverages the power of many by drawing on the breadth of our  Canadian network.  Our movement of change advocates lobby the government for better aid reform and transparency, and leadership towards responsible mining in  Africa.  Throughout the campaign process, we learned the power of the individual, and even more so, the sheer force of many.  Tasting success  In  September 2008, after four years of campaigning, the  Canadian government announced that it would completely untie all of  Canada’s aid by 2012. 2010  The single most prevalent claim advanced by the proponents of a new paradigm is that they can solve the problems that have led the old one to a crisis.  Investing in  Africa's future leaders  The  Kumvana  Fellowship contributes to a network of local innovators in rural  African communities, creating a robust pipeline of talent and change potential.  Learn more about the  Kumvana  Fellowship  More information  Learn, grow, improve, change  As a result, we changed our pre-departure training programs.  We began focusing on how to best work with  African partners to build organizational capacity.  We began hiring local staff for our overseas teams.  The culmination of these initiatives saw the launch of our  Kumvana  Fellowship program.  Reverberating value  Over the first decade of our work, we’ve become increasingly aware of the long-lasting impact our volunteers create in their partner organizations. 2012  Solutions don't emerge immediately or without iteration.  And some may fail entirely, but those that gain traction have the potential to 'change the game' in systems that can affect millions.  Experimenting, evolving, and creating impact  We commit to experiment and prove what works, to shift incentives and power dynamics, and to transform the way people and organizations behave.  In doing so, we can ensure the change we create is meaningful and lasting — systemic innovation for systemic impact.  Venturing forth  Within  EWB’s  Ventures and  Incubator model, we focus on innovations that impact systems — economic, political, social and cultural.  Working on systems, not symptoms  We recognised that many of the barriers to development occur higher up in the system: they’re happening with donor funding requirements, with international trade policies, with rich countries’ aid restrictions and broken commitments.  With the creation of our 2020 vision, the scope of  EWB has expanded to include systems change.  With our proud history behind us, we’re excited and equipped to create a better future.

If we tackle poverty where it is most prevalent and urgent, we can accelerate the pace of change to end poverty and inequality in our lifetime.  Fewer people live in poverty today than ever before in human history.  However, in sub- Saharan  Africa, poverty has doubled, with 413 million people living on less than  US$1.90 a day.  It is soon to have the youngest and largest workforce (450 million people) in the world, with over half of the population living in poverty.  Since our start in 2000,  EWB has worked toward a world without poverty and inequality where it is most prevalent.  We have focused on creating opportunity and access for those living in conditions of poverty.  To solve problems within social, economic and political systems that are inextricably linked.  In order to advance inclusive innovations, we have built diversity into our approach.  Today,  EWB invites and empowers engineers and non-engineers who value collaboration and cooperation to cross-breed solutions to poverty and inequality.  We aim to converge design thinking with systems thinking and elevate our collective passion to create sustainable and inclusive economies.  Through our leadership curriculum and  Fellowships,  EWB offers immersive experiences in  Canada and sub- Saharan  Africa to launch future shapers equipped to understand and re-engineer complex social systems.  By investing in the economic and social prosperity of emerging economies, and championing values that create inclusion, equality and sustainability, we can inspire development behaviour to help the international community end intergenerational poverty and achieve the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.

Please visit the  Canada- Africa  Innovation  Fellowship page to learn more about a new  Fellowship opportunity available exclusively to university students this year.  The  Junior  Fellowship  Program exposes aspiring  Canadian leaders across  Canada’s most sought after universities to the cultural and economic realities of the world’s most promising economies and emerging innovations.  Junior  Fellows have an opportunity to test their skills and contribute to the development of smarter more resilient solutions for social change.  Each  Fellow plays an important role to deliver  EWB’s  Theory of  Change.  They bring their experiences and lessons learned to shape the course of their future and that of their peers; as entrepreneurs, policy-makers, engineers, and business leaders.  EWB’s student-run chapters across university campuses in  Canada run and recruit students for the  Fellowship each year.  Contact your chapter to learn more  What is a  Junior  Fellow?  Junior  Fellows are leaders who play an essential role in linking on-the-ground initiatives with our ongoing chapter activities and are chosen based on a proven commitment to building a more equal and sustainable world.  They are students eager to lead by example and share their experiences upon their return.  They strive for humility and have an interest to critically examine their environments and problem-solve to meet the development needs of our world.  The  Fellowship allows each student to operate at the intersection of poverty, transformation, innovation and education, to spark systemic change in  Canada and  Africa.  You will gain a detailed understanding of the realities of these environments and learn how to positively affect each one.  Your work will be tied to our larger organizational strategy, and your experience, input and effort will influence the strategy’s development. “ Working in  Malawi as a  Junior  Fellow after my first year in university turned my world upside down.  My naive idea of what development meant changed to something more complex, more difficult, more confusing…  I can’t think of any experience that has had a bigger impact on my life’s direction in the past decade.” –  Emily  Stewart, 2008  Junior  Fellow in  Malawi.  What does the program involve?  With practical skills, invaluable insights and access to unrivalled experiences, your preparation as a  Junior  Fellow will extend well beyond the conventions of a traditional leadership program.  As a  Junior  Fellow with  EWB, you will operate outside of the classroom; explore far beyond the confines of an office building.  You will broaden horizons and expand your mind across campuses, fields, cities, villages, businesses, streets, markets and bus stations.  You will build your understanding, knowledge, and a direct, personal connection to our work.  These building blocks will come to life as concrete, real-world change.  The program can include: 4 months of a  Foundation  Learning  Program online and a week of intensive training at our  National  Office in  Toronto. 4 months engaged in work directly with our ventures and partners in  Canada,  Ghana,  Uganda,  Côte d’ Ivoire or  Kenya.  A full year of leadership and mentorship in an  EWB chapter.  You will come out of the program equipped to create an impact on three key capacities:  To create change in sub- Saharan  Africa.  By partnering directly with our ventures on-the-ground to create impact.  To create change in  Canada.  By recounting your experience to educate and inspire fellow  Canadians to change the way we think, feel and act towards  Africa.  You will be equipped to tackle complex domestic issues with a global focus.  To create change and learning for yourself.  The  Junior  Fellowship  Program will equip you with the skills, support and network to generate ongoing impact as a leader.  Whatever your experience and wherever your life takes you beyond the  Fellowship, you will be empowered to enact change.  Meet some of our  Junior  Fellowship alumni  Emily  Nickerson  Sprouting innovations in  Ugandan agriculture.  Participated as a third-year  Water  Resources  Engineering student at the  University of  Guelph.  Partnered with the  Agriculture  Value  Chains venture in the town of  Iganga,  Uganda.  Developed insights on business influence and ownership that scaled to create change in maize, coffee and agricultural inputs value chains.  Working directly with a small agricultural-inputs business,  Emily was able to grow in-depth understanding of field level realities in relation to access and use of agro-inputs by small-scale farmers.  In close collaboration with the business owner,  Emily co-evaluated the potential of a new operating model to help the business enhance its market share and bring quality-certified seed closer to the farm-gate.  Alexandra  Sproule  Mobilizing insight for  Ghanaian farmers.  Participated as a second-year  Arts &  Science student at  Mc Master  University.  Worked with the  Business  Development  Services  Venture in  Northern  Ghana, and later in the more southern city of  Kumasi.  Played a key role in pre-pilot market analysis to ensure a service was launched to the most receptive and appropriate audience base.  Alexandra conducted research into  Farmerline, a service that delivers vital agricultural information directly to farmers’ mobile phones.  Alexandra analyzed the way smallholder crop farmers in  Northern  Ghana use extension services and mobile phones.  After determining this would not be a good initial market for the service,  Alexandra moved south to  Kumasi to help pivot the service for a new market – fish farmers.  There, she developed a partnership with  Ghana’s fisheries commission and held workshops to engage and educate potential clients.  Ryan  Voon  Partnering with district councils for more accountable accounting.  Participated as a second-year  Electrical  Engineering student at the  University of  Alberta.  Worked with the  Governance and  Rural  Infrastructure  Venture at the  West  Gonja  District  Assembly in  Damongo,  Ghana, on revenue mobilization.  Played a key role in developing a system for accurate revenue projections and measures to improve accountability for revenue collectors.  Through partnering with the  District  Assembly as well as  Area  Councils,  Ryan investigated a range of the district’s entrenched challenges.  After initial investigation,  Ryan’s team implemented a  Revenue  Projection  Database and data collection processes to ensure that all financing projections were made based on legitimate figures from the ground.  His team also ensured that contracts were updated to improve the accountability and responsibilities of revenue collectors on commission.  Aditya  Chaudhuri  Breaking new ground for more responsible global mining.  Two-time winner at the first-ever  Canadian  Sustainable  Development  Goals  Awards, 2016.  Co-drafted an international standard for reporting on local procurement for global mining companies.  Participated in  Toronto through the  Mining  Shared  Value  Venture, part of our  Governance and  Sustainable  Services portfolio.  Through his  Junior  Fellowship placement with  Mining  Shared  Value,  Aditya worked on several integral projects to play a key role in taking the venture to new heights.  Over the course of his placement,  Aditya was involved in co-drafting an early iteration of an international standard for reporting on local procurement as a part of corporate social responsibility for mining companies around the world.  In collaboration with the  Deutsche  Gesellschaft für  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  Gmb H,  Aditya mapped out a network of organizations that focus on responsible mining, made recommendations to  Global  Affairs  Canada by participating in  Canada’s  International  Assistance  Review, and more.

The  EWB  Fellowship is designed to help  Canadian professionals gain experience working and living in emerging markets, while critical talent gaps for emerging social enterprises in sub- Saharan  Africa to help them grow and reach their potential.  Every year,  EWB recruits outstanding leaders—typically post-graduate students and professionals—for a 12-month  EWB  Fellowship program.  Fellows come from a variety of professional, technical, and educational backgrounds and are equipped with the skills and opportunities needed to play a critical role in building a thriving, sustainable world.  Fellows provide expertise in  EWB ventures or partner organizations throughout sub- Saharan  Africa.  These experiences help develop critical thinking and empathy to effectively reimagine social and economic systems to get the international community one step closer to achieving the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  EWB would not be able to deliver high-quality leadership and talent training without support.  Global  Affairs  Canada’s  Volunteer  Cooperation  Program ( VCP) supports  Canadian organizations in sending highly skilled and qualified volunteers to developing countries to work with local partners.  EWB is proud to be a part of the  Canadian  Government’s  VCP, which helps us run our  Fellowship  Program.  EWB is one of 15 organizations supported through the  VCP.  Since 2001, the  EWB  Fellowship program has built a community of active and impassioned systems-change leaders working with  African innovators to eradicate global poverty.  Part of what makes this possible is the generous donation of  Aeroplan  Miles.  EWB  Fellowships require a lot of travel – roughly 100,000  Aeroplan  Miles per fellow, and through  Matching  Week  Campaigns each year, we are able to get our  Fellows to the sub-continent of  Africa.  Explore  EWB  Fellowship  Opportunities  Frequently asked questions  Frequently asked questions abut the  EWB  Fellowship program.  Who is eligible for  EWB's long-term fellowship program?  In order to participate, you must be a  Canadian  Citizen or  Permanent  Resident.  You must also have graduated from a post-secondary institution.  Not a  Canadian  Citizen or  Permanent  Resident?  Consider our  Kumvana  Program, which recruits dynamic  African professionals to participate in a leadership development program.  How much do fellows get paid?  The program is costs covered.  All costs relating to the placement are either paid for directly by  EWB (airfare, insurance, vaccinations, trainings) or indirectly through a living stipend, which covers basic living expenses (food, accommodation, local travel) for a modest lifestyle in your placement country.  Fellows also receive an honorarium upon completing their 12 month contract, to assist with repatriation costs in  Canada.  While it is not likely that you will be able to use the stipend to cover previous expenses (ex. student loans),  EWB will support you in extending the non-repayment period on student loans as much as possible.  Additionally,  EWB offers a range of benefits including insurance, a settlement allowance, professional development opportunities, and more.  I’m interested in a couple of roles.  Can  I apply for more than one?  Yes!  We highly encourage  Fellows to apply to more than one role and a maximum of four roles.  I want to apply but  I can’t commit to 12 months.  Are there shorter placements?  Currently, we only offer 12-month placements, as we want to ensure fellows have as much impact as possible working with their organization.

Why are there so few  Engineering roles available?  We are hiring  Engineers!  If you look back through our history, you’ll see that  EWB was founded on the premise of ‘engineers doing good for the world via access to technology.’  However, we have since expanded our efforts to focus on the human systems that perpetuate poverty and inequality in the world and broadened the expertise of our ventures and partner organizations as a result.  We now act as an incubator for social change.  We support early-stage, highly scalable, innovative social enterprises in sub- Saharan  Africa that create systemic change and social impact.  We provide our ventures and partner organizations with the financial and human capital they need to scale and grow.  The fellowship roles available vary each application round, as they are created by our ventures and partner organizations based on current capacity gaps.  In any given round, some partner organizations are looking to fill  Engineering roles, while others are in need of business acumen or tech talent.  However, we’re confident that  Engineering skills are transferable to a wide range of roles.  We encourage all candidates to apply for multiple purposes.  What support will  I receive during my placement?  You’ll receive support from  EWB in  Canada and in your placement country before, during and after your placement.  The  Fellowship program includes:  A three-week pre-departure leadership training program in  Toronto  An orientation program upon arrival in placement country  Professional development retreats organized by  EWB (typically held in  July and  November)  Comprehensive health, safety, and wellness support (including regular check-ins with  EWB staff and health insurance)  Direct management and coaching from ventures  As an  EWB  Fellow, you’ll also be joining a vibrant global community of  EWBers!  Side note:  You’ll be in a vibrant city, supportive community, make lifelong friends  Is the application process lengthy?

At  EWB, we think and act differently.  Our work involves tackling the world’s most challenging problems to lift the collective prospects of our planet.  As a result, we must invest in developing people with a specific set of qualities and abilities.  We call this  Systems  Change  Leadership.  The  Systems  Change  Leadership model equips participants with the skills, vision, values and strategies to create profound and positive change in the world.  Systems  Change  Leadership: fostering pioneers.  To create change, leaders must develop a strong understanding of the tiered nature of systems.  Through identifying the various levels of ingrained social issues, we can address the root causes involved and leverage particular skills and strengths to work towards a thriving and sustainable world.  There are three levels involved in creating systemic change.  Internal systems.  Fostering evolution within our individual mental, physical and emotional selves.  Small systems.  Creating change in local, immediate environment; within teams, ventures and chapter-based initiatives.  Large and complex systems.  Learning skills to transform industries and sectors, on a national and global scale.  Learn through action.  Systems  Change  Leadership involves constant learning through action.  And, the creation of sustainable positive impact as a result of a greater understanding of the world.  We call this continual cycle ‘action-learning’.  As a participant in  EWB’s  Systems  Change  Leadership model, we will help you build skills and create tools that enable you to take thoughtful and strategic actions towards change.  When creating change at any of the three levels, the  Systems  Change  Leadership model encourages you to:  Act:  Take action to bring improvements or innovations in the world.  Reflect:  Think deeply about the experience to identify new opportunities or areas for improvement.  Learn and unlearn:  Grow our knowledge, skills and awareness, while abandoning ineffective ideas or ways of thinking.  Plan:  Develop a vision and propose a concrete course of action.  Establish vision, become a visionary.  We believe people can only solve problems when equipped with a greater perspective—a comprehensive understanding of the wider issues and influencers involved in a system.  Systems  Change  Leadership empowers you to adopt that overarching perspective.  We teach skills to establish and maintain an effective understanding of large and small systems, with the ultimate goal to identify and eliminate the root causes of poverty and inequity within them.  There are six steps involved in establishing potent vision and enacting change.  Address root causes.  Start by clearly defining the impact we want to bring about.  Consider the key components of the system or problem, so that every action targets a root cause.  Strive for humility.  We learn best by being open—being receptive to ideas from anywhere and anyone, and being open about our mistakes and failures.  Invest in people.  True change requires a movement of forward-thinking leaders.  We support and invest in each other to build a movement together.  Courageously commit.  Commit to your own personal growth through regular self-assessment.  Have the courage to ask for feedback.  Ask tough questions.  Scrutinize the past, present and future to determine opportunities for impact.  Dream big and work hard.  Make the impossible possible.  The recipe calls for imagination, hard work, innovation, passion, and a willingness to take risks.  The core competencies of  Systems  Change  Leadership.  Drawing on our extensive experience and collaborative work with many social change organizations, we have identified five core competencies that are critical to leading change.  The continuous development, practice and refinement of these competencies is essential.  Systems mapping & sense-making:  Understand the elements and actors within a system to identify the root of a problem and develop approaches to address it.  Reflection &  Co- Creation:  Think deeply about your actions and approach.  Engage in collaborations with strategic and unexpected partners to develop a comprehensive vision and shared action.  Entrepreneurship/ Intrapreneurship:  Transform a vision into concrete, strategic actions, and find the resources to do so.  Influence:  Participate as an active citizen in society, and influence decision-makers through advocacy, key stakeholder engagement and partnership development.  Personal  Alignment:  Build a life aligned with who you are and the world you are striving to create.  Join a network of like-minded change leaders.  We foster a diverse community of  Systems  Change  Leaders.  Anyone can practice  Systems  Change  Leadership and play a role in driving innovation and impact.  We find strength in numbers.  Our support network is a powerful resource—a rich matrix of motivation, energy and skills tailored to tackle complex challenges and create lasting change.

Many of the factors contributing to global poverty and inequality are embedded deep within systems.  Often, ‘deep’ more accurately refers to ‘high’—with barriers to global development entrenched high up in the operational chains that bring political, economic and industrial systems to action.  The roadblocks are on the ground, but they are also in high-level donor trade policies, industrial regulations, aid restrictions, governmental strategies, sector-wide policy legislation, and service infrastructure.  Our work in  Governance for  Sustainable  Services  Ventures encourages new ways of operating and promotes change advocacy within these complex ecosystems.  The ultimate goal is to refine corporate and governmental practice in  Africa and  Canada, to ensure local communities benefit from public and private initiatives.

WASH  Catalysts |  Malawi &  Uganda  Shifting the focus of  Malawi’s rural water and sanitation sector.  WASH  Coordination |  Malawi  Improving access to water and sanitation services for rural communities.  The approach.  Through the  Governance for  Sustainable  Service channel, we invest in ventures that have the potential to improve the way social services are governed, financed and delivered in sub- Saharan  Africa.  Facilitating change of systemic magnitude is a challenge, but it is not impossible.  It requires establishing networks, fostering innovation and embedding support.  We create and influence networks for large net gains.  Whether mining or water and sanitation, service delivery is often dictated by the influence of multiple stakeholders, regulatory bodies and industrial partners.  A tiered approach to improvement is essential.  GSS ventures seek to create vertically-linked networks at the district, institutional, national and global levels, collaborating with key people to incite palpable change.  For example:  Partnering with  Federal  Ministries to develop national reporting and operational standards. ( Mining  Shared  Value)  Fostering management support and training at the local development level, to ensure the ongoing implementation of ventures. ( WASH  Coordination)  Supporting local government offices to develop stronger and more beneficial connections with national-level administrative bodies. ( WASH  Catalysts)  Connecting industry personnel with development practitioners to facilitate discussions and create collaborative partnerships. ( Mining  Shared  Value)  We experiment to evolve.  GSS ventures promote an experimental mindset and a culture of progressive leadership within communities of partners and stakeholders.  We bring a commitment to experiment with new behaviours and approaches, in an effort to shift governance dynamics that prevent people from accessing basic human rights.  This includes:  Designing and testing strategies for more sustainable service delivery. ( WASH  Catalysts/ Mining  Shared  Value)  Developing and advocating for new policies in company structures, industry standards and governance models. ( Mining  Shared  Value/ WASH  Catalysts)  Assisting organisations to implement processes for sector coordination, such as budgeting frameworks and operational recommendations. ( WASH  Catalysts)  We embed ongoing support.  We have refined our venture support services over the past 10+ years, taking valuable lessons from each investee and initiative along the way.  We support  Governance for  Sustainable  Services ventures through providing support and consultation from our embedded  Fellows.  They offer insight into:  Business development.  Financial modelling.  Talent acquisition.  Investor preparation.  Leadership training.  Learn more about our  Fellows  The outcomes.  Governance for  Sustainable  Services  Ventures generate immediate benefit on-the-ground for local communities, while cultivating long term improvements to wider systems and services.  Regardless of the industry, sector or service,  Governance for  Sustainable  Service  Ventures can:  Facilitate skill and technology transfers from global and national entities to local communities.  Formalize and strengthen local communities.  Create employment opportunities in host economies.  Scale improved approaches to service delivery.  Create policy and institutional changes that influence corporate and government practices to unlock opportunities for sustainable growth.  The strategy.  Our  Governance for  Sustainable  Services strategy focuses on achieving universal access to basic services by 2030.  We believe that goal can be achieved by operating with an awareness of the underlying systems that result in the current status quo.  Governance for  Sustainable  Service ventures allow our  Fellows to source data, catalogue challenges, and use the information to advocate for legislative, operational and industrial change.

The engineering profession has a unique and vital role to play in ensuring we move towards the world we want to see—one with more universal equality, sustainability and wellbeing.  The reason is engineers play a key role in shaping the relationship between technology and society, which will have massive implications on all aspects of humanity.  Technology holds the potential to drive economic development, tackle the sustainable development goals and grand challenges of the 21st century, and even enhance our very humanity through increased connectivity and higher creativity.  For the engineering profession to live up to its full potential and guide this relationship, we believe engineers will have to develop new skills and expand their understanding.  Through increased socio-technological expertise, the engineering community can enact more impactful leadership.  What is the higher potential that we mention for the engineering profession?  A global movement of engineers leveraging deep technological understanding in collaboration with diverse leaders to anticipate challenges, frame opportunities to benefit society, and deliver solutions.  As the relationship between technology and society continues to evolve, we must continuously evolve engineering to ensure we live up to our potential.

Engineers of  Tomorrow  From solo tinkering to solving the most important problems of the 21st century.  The  Global  Engineering  Initiative  Encouraging the next crop of engineers to focus on global development.  The approach.  Our approach is to foster a global movement focused on updating the purpose of the engineering profession to create greater social impact.  We will create a movement for change through regularly convening with leading personnel, community members, and organizational bodies from the engineering profession to determine industry-wide challenges and opportunities for growth.  In order to catalyze this movement and create seismic change within  Canada’s 600,000 person engineering community, we adopt a broad and multi-layered approach.  Evolving  Engineering initiatives are:  Systemically focussed.  To challenge the fundamental structure and models that govern the behaviour of any system, we target key leverage points on a wide spectrum.  From high-level industry developments in the private sector, to young and bright-eyed engineering students – the approach to sparking evolution must be comprehensive and cater to every touchpoint of our professional ecosystem.  Collaborative.  Drawing on our 15-plus years’ experience working with pioneering engineers and a global network of key personnel from within the industry,  Evolving  Engineering initiatives take action in close consultation and deep partnership with other organizations.  This ensures we work ‘with’ rather than ‘on’ the engineering profession.  Experimental.  As a profession, if we fail to engage in activities that truly risk failure, we are simply ‘colouring within the lines’ of the existing system.  Without experimentation, innovation, and exploration of new ways of doing, thinking, and creating, the engineering profession cannot achieve the transformative nature of the change that is required.

We support entrepreneurs from seed to global scale; from idea to widespread impact.  The initiatives begin locally, but they have the capacity to eradicate poverty and create far-reaching change.  The  EWB ventures program makes customized, long-term investments of up to $100,000  USD in first-of-kind scalable social enterprises with the potential to positively impact millions of people living in poverty.  Sub- Saharan  Africa has the highest rates of early-stage entrepreneurship on the planet; over 250 million of the continent’s citizens work in 17.7 million small and growing businesses.  Many sub- Saharan economies are on the verge of a dramatic transformation, with small and growing businesses exploring increasingly progressive means to kick-start significant growth across multiple sectors: including smallholder agriculture, water and sanitation services, communications technology, and more.  These businesses can blossom to serve millions.  Their innovations can lift the collective prospects of large communities.  Ventures can eliminate hunger; they can increase health education, housing infrastructure, employment opportunities, community safety, and access to basic financing.  They simply need the right support.  Through a unique approach to investment, we partner with forward-thinking businesses and community organizations.  By investing capital, support and expertise, we improve the way these innovative small and growing businesses operate to help eradicate poverty and inequity.

Impact investing: our philosophy and strategy. “ We invest capital, talent and mentorship to ignite founding-stage social enterprises in  Sub- Saharan  Africa.”  Impact investing involves more than injecting capital and hoping for the best.  It is a robust methodology designed to bolster innovative businesses and accelerate their potential influence.  By investing time, capital and personal expertise, we can build capacity, ensure sustainability and bring inventive ideas to fruition for the benefit of millions at global scale.  We call this comprehensive approach  Impact  Investing.  Since the establishment of  EWB ventures, our impact investments have contributed to influencing the lives of over 22 million people at both an individual and systemic level.  The approach is designed to solve deeply-rooted systemic barriers that prevent communities from growth and prosperity.  The results usher in new industries and improved ways of doing things.  When these innovations successfully scale, our impact investments create positive change for individuals and communities.  We invest talent.  Many social entrepreneurs report ‘inability to access talent’ as having a high or critical impact on growth.  We recruit and embed  EWB  Fellows from a deeply talented professional network, to offer diverse capability and comprehensive support.  Sustainability is key.  Immediate access to expertise and talent is essential throughout the early stages of a social venture.  We focus on knowledge exchange and building partnerships: many of our  Fellows choose to remain in positions with ventures long after their initial placement.  We invest expertise.  We provide burgeoning enterprises with broad insight into:  Business development.  Financial modelling.  Talent acquisition.  Investor-preparation.  Leadership training and mentoring.  We provide investment for the future.  Funding a venture to the point of scale is futile without support for the next steps toward scalability and greater success.  To ensure ongoing growth, we catalyze future investment for initiatives that are ready to graduate beyond the nurture stage.  Contact: investments@ewb.ca  View our past and current ventures  Our unique approach.  The impact investing methodology is proving fruitful for entrepreneurs and investors alike.  EWB’s early-stage capital has so far been leveraged 6.5 times.  Like the entrepreneurs we support, the  EWB approach to investing in ventures is progressive.  We nurture new sectors.  We foster widespread growth through a portfolio approach, amplifying the impact of individual ventures by connecting them with other complementary businesses charting new territory.  The collaborative method creates a supportive environment for learning, sector innovation, and scalable impact.  Additionally, by documenting the successes and challenges these business communities face, we collect shared insight and accumulative evidence to advocate for impactful policy change.  Learn more about our work in advocating for change  We partner early to support innovators through difficult developmental situations.  Weak pipelines represent major difficulties for scalable social-purpose ventures in  Africa – they are a hurdle for investors and create challenges for innovative businesses looking for support.  Our investment approach solves this issue by backing ventures at ground zero, providing diverse expertise and resources when support is hardest to obtain.  We bring others in to secure comprehensive support.  The impact investment approach de-risks the earliest stage of the investment pipeline.  As a result, additional investment is easier to attract, building the chorus of support innovative businesses require to scale and succeed.  We embed expertise.  At the founding-stage of progressive businesses, talent is often scarce and can be even more vital than capital.  We recognize the importance of experience and expertise.  Through our  Fellowships programs, we provide  African innovators with access to people with the critical skills required to grow businesses.  Learn more about the  Fellowships programs  We draw on deep experience in  Africa.  Our  Africa-based investment committee leverages their 34 years of collective experience in investing, corporate finance, and development.  Beyond the  African investment team, our 16 years of institutional experience and deep networks play a valuable role in recognizing potential innovators and helping grow their ventures.  Meet the investment committee  The ongoing impact of investment.  As founding investors and partners in many ventures, we are well-placed to participate in the long-term value we’ve helped create: bolstering our sustainability and the potential to foster further small and growing business initiatives.  All returns generated through our investments go towards new investments and support the ongoing sustainable growth of additional portfolio partners.  As a result, the benefits of ventures resonate well beyond the support for initial entrepreneurs themselves.  Innovative product and service development.  Forward-thinking businesses operating in the challenging circumstances of sub- Saharan  Africa generate new methods of service delivery and create exciting products.  They lead – and develop entirely new – industries.  Motivated competition.  Successful initiatives can spur established organizations to reconsider their own operations, and work more consistently towards honing their products and improving services.  Success through failure.  We embrace failure as an essential learning process.  It’s a chance to learn and refine.  Ventures that fail to successfully scale can inspire other entrepreneurs to identify shortcomings or potential improvements and capitalize on the opportunities they identify.  Establishing blueprints.  Proven pioneers create clear pathways to success for future innovators in the small and growing business sector.  This ensures the impact of our investments into ventures reverberates long after the success of any single funded entrepreneur.

This collaboration builds partnerships that are creating jobs and addressing social issues using technology and innovation.

In addition,  I now actively advocate for effective funding towards programs in developing countries which have been shown to have net positive social, economic, and environmental benefits to the communities impacted.  Also, being involved in the  EWB community along with running a university chapter was the highlight of my undergraduate degree.” JEFFRAY  BEHR  Former  Chapter  President,  EWB  University of  Waterloo SUBSCRIBE  TO  OUR  NEWSLETTER!
