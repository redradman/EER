What is  Social  Entrepreneurship?  At  SEC, we refer to social enterprise as the practice of combining innovation, resourcefulness and opportunity to address critical social and environmental challenges.  The key concepts of social entrepreneurship are innovation, market orientation and systems change.  What is a  Social  Entrepreneur?  A social entrepreneur is an individual focused on transforming systems and practices that are the root causes of social and environmental issues.  In so doing, they may set up for-profit or not-for-profit organizations, and in either case, their primary objective is to create sustainable systematic change.  What is a  Social  Enterprise?  A business that operates not only to generate profit but whose core mission revolves around creating measurable impact.

We  Are the  Social  Enterprise  Club  This is our story  Who  Are  We  In 2012, the  UBC  Social  Enterprise  Club emerged as an idea cultivated by passionate, innovative and motivated students looking for ways to create change in the world.  Since then,  SEC has engaged thousands of students and grown to an inter-faculty club that seeks to bridge disciplines, unite students and social enterprise, and create changemakers.  Our  Goals  We strive to create a lasting impact on campus by educating, empowering and inspiring students to become catalysts for sustainable positive change and think of creative answers to the social issues that have gone unaddressed in our world.  We aim to cultivate a community that dares to challenge the status quo, exceed expectations, and create systemic impact.  What is  Social  Enterprise  We define a social enterprise as an organization that cares about more than just profit, but rather one that innovates on business models to achieve a triple bottom line: profit to be re-invested in social good, social impact, and environmental impact.  Social entrepreneurs are drivers of this change that disrupts the status quo and transforms our world.  We  Bridge  Disciplines  We believe you can’t form a business with just business students and that everyone has the ability to create an immense change in the world.  We also know that connecting diverse skill-sets is very powerful for social innovation and therefore put a great emphasis on “bridging disciplines” and bringing students from all faculties together.  We  Unite  Students and  Social  Enterprise  We are strong believers that social entrepreneurship is not simply a profession – but also a mindset.  The students of  UBC are tomorrow’s leaders and we strive to facilitate the engagement of students with entrepreneurs and concepts in the social enterprise field.  We provide a diverse range of opportunities for students of all faculties to get involved and explore how they can drive change and be socially innovative throughout their career, whatever their career may be.  We  Create  Changemakers  SEC imagines a world where business is used as a tool for social good, for making a sustainable impact, and for ultimately creating a better world.  We imagine a world built on trust and dignity, one that values communities over compensation and one in which innovation stems from the promise of doing good.  Our goal is to accelerate the growth of the changemaker network at  UBC and to encourage all students to consider the power they have to make a difference.  Want  To  Get  Involved?
