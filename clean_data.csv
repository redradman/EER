Engineers without borders,https://www.ewb.ca/en/about-us/our-approach/,"In our increasingly tech-driven world, many remain excluded from its benefits. At Engineers Without Borders Canada, we recognize that technology alone can’t drive real and lasting change. True progress requires a holistic approach, considering cultural, behavioral, and political factors.

With this ethos, we leverage engineering and technology to create a more equitable and sustainable future. Join us in making engineered technology a force for good – for people, and for the planet. To engineer an equitable and sustainable future for marginalized people and the planet. To create systemic change through community-driven collaboration. We mobilize the engineering community and leverage technological innovation to address urgent and important global challenges, both within Canada and beyond. At Engineers Without Borders Canada, our first goal is optimization. We focus our efforts on addressing urgent and important global challenges where engineering can drive significant change.

Engineers without borders,https://www.ewb.ca/en/about-us/history/,"Engineers Without Borders Canada was born. From a weekly meeting to the world: with humble beginnings and a bi-weekly meeting in George’s parents’ living room, the dream slowly grew into reality. By the end of 2000, the initiative was supported by over 1000 members and a handful of chapters around the country. In 2001, our first volunteer left for a four-month internship in India. What do communities need? Bunker Roy on a better approach: we needed to begin by asking not 'what do we bring?', but instead, 'what do communities need?' It was only through answering this second question that we could begin to understand our role. Bunker Roy, founder of the Barefoot Colleges, delivered a strong dose of humility at our first National Conference in Montreal. Unlearning our approach meant focusing less on engineering technology, and serving the specific needs of communities. At the end of the day, all we do is work for Dorothy. We work in the service of something — someone — else. Something greater. Parker Mitchell: by talking about Dorothy, we don't mean to oversimplify. There are 900 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, and we aren't working with all of them, and there isn't one person who represents all of them. But we wanted to have a person to remind us of who we are working for. From that point on, Dorothy became a focal point; our most important stakeholder, an embodiment of our motivations, and a source of ongoing inspiration. Whether you change or not, we are going to make it happen. We will untie Canada's aid. It's not a matter of if... it's a matter of when. In 2004, we began a four-year campaign lobbying the Canadian government to untie Canada’s development aid. Tied aid required the recipients of Canada’s foreign aid to purchase exclusively Canadian goods and services – ultimately benefitting Canadian companies and wasting aid money. Campaigning comes to fruition. In September 2008, after four years of campaigning, the Canadian government announced that it would completely untie all of Canada’s aid by 2012. Our ongoing advocacy work leverages the power of many by drawing on the breadth of our Canadian network. Our movement of change advocates lobby the government for better aid reform and transparency, and leadership towards responsible mining in Africa. Investing in Africa's future leaders. The Kumvana Fellowship contributes to a network of local innovators in rural African communities, creating a robust pipeline of talent and change potential. Over the first decade of our work, we’ve become increasingly aware of the long-lasting impact our volunteers create in their partner organizations. We began hiring local staff for our overseas teams. The culmination of these initiatives saw the launch of our Kumvana Fellowship program. Solutions don't emerge immediately or without iteration. And some may fail entirely, but those that gain traction have the potential to 'change the game' in systems that can affect millions. We commit to experiment and prove what works, to shift incentives and power dynamics, and to transform the way people and organizations behave. In doing so, we can ensure the change we create is meaningful and lasting — systemic innovation for systemic impact. With the creation of our 2020 vision, the scope of EWB has expanded to include systems change."
Engineers without borders,https://www.ewb.ca/en/what-we-do/investing-in-people/,"We identify, encourage, and equip talented leaders to lift the collective prospects of our planet. If we tackle poverty where it is most prevalent and urgent, we can accelerate the pace of change to end poverty and inequality in our lifetime. Fewer people live in poverty today than ever before in human history. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, poverty has doubled, with 413 million people living on less than US$1.90 a day. It is soon to have the youngest and largest workforce (450 million people) in the world, with over half of the population living in poverty. Since our start in 2000, EWB has worked toward a world without poverty and inequality where it is most prevalent. We have focused on creating opportunity and access for those living in conditions of poverty. To solve problems within social, economic and political systems that are inextricably linked. In order to advance inclusive innovations, we have built diversity into our approach. Today, EWB invites and empowers engineers and non-engineers who value collaboration and cooperation to cross-breed solutions to poverty and inequality. We aim to converge design thinking with systems thinking and elevate our collective passion to create sustainable and inclusive economies.

Engineers without borders,https://www.ewb.ca/en/what-we-do/investing-in-people/leadership-development/,"At EWB, we think and act differently. Our work involves tackling the world’s most challenging problems to lift the collective prospects of our planet. As a result, we must invest in developing people with a specific set of qualities and abilities. We call this Systems Change Leadership. To create change, leaders must develop a strong understanding of the tiered nature of systems. Through identifying the various levels of ingrained social issues, we can address the root causes involved and leverage particular skills and strengths to work towards a thriving and sustainable world. There are three levels involved in creating systemic change: Fostering evolution within our individual mental, physical, and emotional selves. Creating change in the local, immediate environment; within teams, ventures, and chapter-based initiatives. Learning skills to transform industries and sectors, on a national and global scale. Systems Change Leadership involves constant learning through action, and the creation of sustainable positive impact as a result of a greater understanding of the world. We call this continual cycle ‘action-learning’. As a participant in EWB’s Systems Change Leadership model, we will help you build skills and create tools that enable you to take thoughtful and strategic actions towards change. When creating change at any of the three levels, the Systems Change Leadership model encourages you. Take action to bring improvements or innovations in the world. Think deeply about the experience to identify new opportunities or areas for improvement. Grow our knowledge, skills, and awareness while abandoning ineffective ideas or ways of thinking. Develop a vision and propose a concrete course of action. We believe people can only solve problems when equipped with a greater perspective—a comprehensive understanding of the wider issues and influencers involved in a system. Systems Change Leadership empowers you to adopt that overarching perspective. We teach skills to establish and maintain an effective understanding of large and small systems, with the ultimate goal to identify and eliminate the root causes of poverty and inequity within them. Address Root Causes: Start by clearly defining the impact we want to bring about. Consider the key components of the system or problem, so that every action targets a root cause. Strive for Humility: We learn best by being open—being receptive to ideas from anywhere and anyone, and being open about our mistakes and failures. Invest in People: True change requires a movement of forward-thinking leaders. We support and invest in each other to build a movement together. Courageously Commit: Commit to your own personal growth through regular self-assessment. Have the courage to ask for feedback. Ask Tough Questions: Scrutinize the past, present, and future to determine opportunities for impact. Dream Big and Work Hard: Make the impossible possible. The recipe calls for imagination, hard work, innovation, passion, and a willingness to take risks. Drawing on our extensive experience and collaborative work with many social change organizations, we have identified five core competencies that are critical to leading change. The continuous development, practice, and refinement of these competencies are essential: Systems Mapping & Sense-Making: Understand the elements and actors within a system to identify the root of a problem and develop approaches to address it. Reflection & Co-Creation: Think deeply about your actions and approach. Engage in collaborations with strategic and unexpected partners to develop a comprehensive vision and shared action. Entrepreneurship or Intrapreneurship: Transform a vision into concrete, strategic actions, and find the resources to do so. Influence: Participate as an active citizen in society, and influence decision-makers through advocacy, key stakeholder engagement, and partnership development. Personal Alignment: Build a life aligned with who you are and the world you are striving to create."
